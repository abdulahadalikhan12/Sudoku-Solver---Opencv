# Sudoku-Solver---Opencv
The Sudoku Solver uses OpenCV to detect and solve Sudoku puzzles from images. It applies image processing techniques like thresholding and contour detection to extract the grid, then uses OCR for digit recognition. The puzzle is solved with backtracking or AI-based methods, and the solution is overlaid onto the image for visualization.
